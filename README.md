## Filtering

Path components matching any entry in `FILTERED_COMPONENTS` are excluded from diffs. In addition to the hardcoded defaults, you can add extra filtered components by creating a `.filtered_components.txt` file in the root of the repository being analyzed. Each line in the file is treated as a component name to filter out.
